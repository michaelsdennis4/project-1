Tic Tac Toe


This is an interactive tic tac toe web application for two players.
User must press "Start New Game" to begin.
Users have the option of entering their names, prior to playing.
If players' names are entered, winners' names will appear on the leader board, along with a tally of games won.
The leader board is reset when the web page is reloaded.
Each player has ten seconds to make their move. If they don't make it in that time, they forfeit the game to the opponent.
